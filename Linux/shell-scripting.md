### Shell Scripting Basics

Shell scripting refers to writing scripts or programs in a shell language, typically for automating tasks or performing various system operations within a Unix/Linux command-line interface. The shell acts as an interpreter, executing commands from scripts line by line.

### Key Concepts

- Shell
A shell is a command-line interpreter that provides a user interface for accessing an operating system's services. Common Unix/Linux shells include Bash (Bourne Again Shell), sh (Bourne Shell), csh (C Shell), and zsh (Z Shell).

- Shebang (#!)
The shebang line at the beginning of a script specifies the shell interpreter to use when executing the script. For example:
`#!/usr/bin/bash`

- Variables
Variables are used to store data and can be referenced or manipulated within the script. Variable names are case-sensitive and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores. They are assigned values using the = operator, without spaces around it. `name="John"`

To access the value of a variable, prefix its name with the $ symbol: `echo "Hello, $name"`

- Conditional Statements
if-else: Executes a block of code based on a condition.

```bash
if [ condition ]; then
    # Code to execute if condition is true
else
    # Code to execute if condition is false
fi
```
- case: Executes different blocks of code based on the value of a variable.

```bash
case $variable in
    pattern1)
        # Code for pattern1
        ;;
    pattern2)
        # Code for pattern2
        ;;
    *)
        # Default code
        ;;
esac
```

- Loops
for: Executes a block of code repeatedly for each item in a list.

```bash
for item in list; do
    # Code to execute for each item
done
```
- while: Executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is true.
```bash
while [ condition ]; do
    # Code to execute as long as condition is true
done
```

- Functions
Functions allow you to group code into reusable blocks and improve script modularity.

```bash
my_function() {
    # Function body
    echo "Hello from my function"
}

# Call the function
my_function
```

- Command Line Arguments

Shell scripts can accept arguments passed from the command line using special variables:

$0: Name of the script.
$1, $2, ...: Positional parameters representing arguments passed to the script.
